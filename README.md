# Welcome to my Venn Diagram!

In this project I'll try to create a solution by configuring this diagram for visualizing of career path with involving MBTI Cognitive Functions.

Here three circles representing interests, skills, and needs:

- Interests circle will represent artistic and philosophical interests, emphasizing creativity and deep thinking.
- Skills circle will showcase technical skills alongside nutritional expertise, demonstrating a multidisciplinary approach.
- Needs circle will encompass financial and health needs, emphasizing effective communication for holistic solutions.

When the three circles overlap, it will give us a career option to choose. In this case, programming seems to be the best option to go with.

## Cognitive Functions (Needs Work)
(Title)

### Intersections

By exploring the intersections of these circles, we unlock cognitive functions that showcases MBTI personality traits:

- The intersection of the first and second circles gives rise to Fe, fostering empathy and harmonious interactions.
- The intersection of the second and third circles reveals Si, bringing attention to detail and practicality.
- The intersection of the first and third circles uncovers Ti, promoting logical analysis and problem-solving.
- The intersection of all three circles represents Ne, encouraging innovation and exploration.

## Conclusion

- Artistic and philosophical insights to drive innovative solutions.
- Technical skills applied in conjunction with nutritional expertise.
- Holistic approach addressing financial, health, and communication needs.
- Emphasis on empathy, attention to detail, logical analysis, and innovation.

## Coding Solution (Needs Work) 

I'm considering using Python as my primary programming language for this data visualization project due to its versatility and popularity in this field. Currently, I utilize the `PyQt5`, `matplotlib` library to create circles that visually represent the relationships between given sets. 

## Tools & Environment
Interpreter: Python 3.11\
IDE: PyCharm 2023.1.2 (Community Edition)\
OS: Windows 11 & Ubuntu 23.04

## License (Needs Work) 

Specifying the license under which the project is released. It's the MIT License.
