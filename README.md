# Welcome to my Venn Diagram!

In this project I'll try to create a solution with configuring this diagram for visualizing of career path with involving MBTI Cognitive Functions.

Here three circles representing interests, skills, and needs that will intersect to form a unique blend:

- The first circle will represent artistic and philosophical interests, emphasizing creativity and deep thinking.
- The second circle will showcase technical skills alongside nutritional expertise, demonstrating a multidisciplinary approach.
- The third circle will encompass financial and healthy needs, emphasizing effective communication for holistic solutions.

## Cognitive Functions
By exploring the intersections of these circles, we unlock cognitive functions that showcases MBTI personality traits:

- The intersection of the first and second circles gives rise to Fe, fostering empathy and harmonious interactions.
- The intersection of the second and third circles reveals Si, bringing attention to detail and practicality.
- The intersection of the first and third circles uncovers Ti, promoting logical analysis and problem-solving.
- Lastly, the intersection of all three circles represents Ne, encouraging innovation and exploration.
