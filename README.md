# Welcome to my Venn Diagram!

In this project, I'll try to create a solution by configuring this diagram for visualizing of career path with involving MBTI Cognitive Functions.

Here three circles representing these following components:

- Interests circle represents artistic and philosophical interests, emphasizing creativity and deep thinking.
- Skills circle showcases technical skills alongside nutritional expertise, demonstrating a multidisciplinary approach.
- Needs circle encompasses financial and health needs, emphasizing effective communication for holistic solutions.

When the three circles overlap, it will give us a career option to choose. In this case, programming seems to be the best option to go with.

###
## Cognitive Functions

The project includes visualizations of using the MBTI cognitive functions. Here's a breakdown of the circles and their corresponding functions:

- First Circle: Fi (Introverted Feeling) represents an individual's inner values and personal ethics.
- Second Circle: Se (Extraverted Sensing) & Ni (Introverted Intuition). Se focuses on gathering concrete information from the environment in the present moment, while Ni helps recognize patterns and understand abstract concepts.
- Third Circle: Te (Extraverted Thinking) involves organizing and structuring the external world, making logical decisions, and achieving goals.


### Intersections

By exploring the intersections of these circles, we unlock cognitive functions that showcases MBTI personality traits:

- The intersection of the first and second circles gives rise to Fe, fostering empathy and harmonious interactions.
- The intersection of the second and third circles reveals Si, bringing attention to detail and practicality.
- The intersection of the first and third circles uncovers Ti, promoting logical analysis and problem-solving.
- The intersection of all three circles represents Ne, encouraging innovation and exploration.

### Conclusion

- Artistic and philosophical insights to drive innovative solutions.
- Technical skills applied in conjunction with nutritional expertise.
- Holistic approach addressing financial, health, and communication needs.
- Emphasis on empathy, attention to detail, logical analysis, and innovation.

## Coding Solution

I'm considering using Python as my primary programming language for this data visualization project due to its versatility and popularity in this field. The project consists of multiple code files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `main_window.py`: the main window implementation for the visualization project. It utilizes the `PyQt5` library for GUI development.
- `all_three_circles.py`: creates a visualization with three circles, representing artistic and philosophical interests, technical and nutritional skills, and financial and healthy needs.
- `interests_circle.py`: creates a visualization specifically focusing on artistic and philosophical interests.
- `skills_circle.py`: creates a visualization specifically focusing on technical and nutritional skills.
- `needs_circle.py`: creates a visualization specifically focusing on financial, health, and communication needs.

Each code file includes functions that generate the respective visualizations using the `Matplotlib` library. The visualizations are then rendered using `PyQt5` to display them as interactive widgets.

Feel free to explore the code files to understand the implementation details and how the visualizations are created.
